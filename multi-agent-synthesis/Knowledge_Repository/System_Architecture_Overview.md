- Phase 3 Agents: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, QA, DevOps

## Information Flow
1. Scoping Phase: Requirements → Project_Brief.md → PRD.md
2. Design Phase: PRD.md → TDD.md
3. Implementation Phase: TDD.md → Epics/ → User_Stories/ → Code

## Human Integration Points
- Project Brief approval
- PRD approval  
- TDD approval
- Sprint review and acceptance
- Deployment approval
