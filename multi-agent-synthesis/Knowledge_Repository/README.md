# Multi-Agent SDLC System

## Overview
This directory contains the foundational knowledge base for the Multi-Agent SDLC System. All agents have read/write access to this centralized repository.

This repository contains the foundational knowledge base for an advanced **Multi-Agent Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) System** designed to automate and streamline the entire software development process from initial scoping to deployment, with robust human oversight and collaboration.

The system orchestrates specialized AI agents across three distinct phases, each with defined roles, responsibilities, and quality gates, ensuring high-quality software delivery while maintaining human control at critical decision points.

## SDLC Phases Explained

### **Phase 1: Scoping & Requirements Engineering**
- **Objective:** Analyze project requirements, conduct research, and produce a detailed project brief and Product Requirements Document (PRD).
- **Key Agents:** Business Analyst, Market Researcher, Documentation Agent
- **Outputs:** Project_Brief.md, PRD.md
- **Human Input:** Mandatory review and approval of Project Brief and PRD.

### **Phase 2: Technical Design & Architecture**
- **Objective:** Create comprehensive technical design documentation (TDD) based on approved requirements.
- **Key Agents:** Solutions Architect, Technical Designer
- **Outputs:** TDD.md
- **Human Input:** Mandatory review and validation of TDD.

### **Phase 3: Agile Implementation & Delivery**
- **Objective:** Break down designs into Epics and User Stories, manage sprints, implement code, test, and prepare for deployment.
- **Key Agents:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, QA, DevOps
- **Outputs:** Epics, User Stories, Source Code, Test Reports, Deployment Scripts
- **Human Input:** Human approval required before deployment and at sprint review milestones.
