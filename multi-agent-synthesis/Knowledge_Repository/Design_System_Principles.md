# Design System Principles

This document outlines the core principles that guide our design system. The UI/UX Designer Agent is responsible for upholding these principles.

## 1. Core Philosophy

- **User-Centric:** The user is at the center of all design decisions. Every component and flow should be intuitive and solve a real user problem.
- **Consistent:** The user experience should be consistent across the entire platform. Components should look and behave predictably.
- **Accessible:** Our application must be usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. We will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Efficient:** The design system should empower developers to build high-quality interfaces quickly and efficiently.

## 2. Component Design

- **Modularity:** Components should be self-contained and reusable.
- **Composability:** Simple components should be combined to create more complex ones.
- **Customizability:** Components should be customizable through a clear and predictable API (e.g., props).

## 3. Visual Style

- **Color:** The color palette is defined and should be used consistently. Do not introduce new colors without approval.
- **Typography:** The typographic scale is defined to ensure a clear visual hierarchy.
- **Spacing:** Use the defined spacing scale for all margins, padding, and layout positioning.

## 4. Contribution Process

- **Proposing a New Component:** [Details on how to propose a new component]
- **Modifying an Existing Component:** [Details on the process for modifying existing components]
- **Review and Approval:** All changes to the design system must be reviewed and approved by the UI/UX Designer Agent and a human reviewer.
