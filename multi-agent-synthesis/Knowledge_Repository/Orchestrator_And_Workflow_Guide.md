# Central Orchestrator and Workflow Management

## Overview

The Central Orchestrator is the core component that manages the entire SDLC workflow, coordinating agent activities and ensuring proper sequencing of tasks.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Workflow Management:** Sequences SDLC phases, activating and deactivating agents based on project stage
- **Task Assignment:** Assigns specific tasks to available agents
- **State Management:** Manages shared state and artifact access control
- **Communication:** Facilitates communication between agents
- **Human Integration:** Flags human intervention points

## Workflow Example

1. **Phase 1:** Requirements Analyst and Market Researcher generate inputs → Documentation Agent creates Project_Brief.md and PRD.md
2. **Human Review:** Orchestrator flags PRD.md for human review and approval
3. **Phase 2:** Once PRD.md is approved → Solution Architect and Technical Designer create TDD.md
4. **Human Review:** TDD.md flagged for technical expert review
5. **Phase 3:** Upon TDD.md approval → Product Owner creates Epics/ and User_Stories/ → Scrum Master plans sprints → Developer Agents begin implementation
6. **Continuous Loop:** QA Agents test code, DevOps Agent manages builds

## Agent Activation Rules

- No agent activates until prerequisites are met
- Human approval required at key milestones
- Agents deactivate upon task completion
- Error handling and rollback procedures in place
