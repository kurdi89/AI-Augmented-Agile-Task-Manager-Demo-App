# User Story: US-005 - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Story Overview
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** implement role-based access control  
**So that** users have appropriate permissions based on their roles within teams and projects  

## Story Details
- **Epic**: Epic 01 - User Authentication & Authorization
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Priority**: High
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1
- **Assignee**: Backend Developer 2
- **Status**: Ready for Development

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Role System Definition
**Given** the system needs role-based access control  
**When** I define the role hierarchy  
**Then** the system should support:
- **Super Admin**: Full system access, user management
- **Organization Admin**: Organization-level management
- **Project Manager**: Project creation and team management
- **Team Member**: Task management within assigned projects
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to assigned projects

### AC-002: Permission Matrix Implementation
**Given** different user roles exist  
**When** users attempt various actions  
**Then** the system should enforce:
- Super Admin: All permissions
- Organization Admin: Manage organization, users, projects
- Project Manager: Create projects, manage team members, all project tasks
- Team Member: Create/edit/delete own tasks, view team tasks
- Viewer: Read-only access to assigned projects and tasks

### AC-003: Role Assignment
**Given** I am an admin user  
**When** I assign roles to users  
**Then** I should be able to:
- Assign roles at organization level
- Assign roles at project level
- Override organization roles for specific projects
- View all user role assignments
- Audit role changes

### AC-004: Permission Validation
**Given** a user attempts to perform an action  
**When** the system checks permissions  
**Then** it should:
- Validate user authentication
- Check user roles and permissions
- Allow or deny access based on permissions
- Log access attempts for audit
- Return appropriate error messages for denied access

### AC-005: Dynamic Permission Checking
**Given** users have different roles in different contexts  
**When** they access different parts of the application  
**Then** the system should:
- Check permissions in real-time
- Update UI based on user permissions
- Hide/show features based on access rights
- Prevent unauthorized API calls
- Handle role changes without requiring re-login

## Technical Requirements

### Backend API Endpoints
```
GET /api/roles
- Response: { success, roles: [{ id, name, permissions }] }
- Status Codes: 200 (Success), 401 (Unauthorized)

POST /api/users/:userId/roles
- Request Body: { roleId, scope, scopeId }
- Response: { success, message }
- Status Codes: 201 (Created), 400 (Invalid), 403 (Forbidden)

GET /api/users/:userId/permissions
- Response: { success, permissions: [{ resource, actions }] }
- Status Codes: 200 (Success), 401 (Unauthorized)

POST /api/auth/check-permission
- Request Body: { resource, action, context }
- Response: { success, hasPermission, reason }
- Status Codes: 200 (Success), 401 (Unauthorized)
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    permissions JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    scope VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'global', 'organization', 'project'
    scope_id UUID, -- organization_id or project_id
    assigned_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, role_id, scope, scope_id)
);

CREATE TABLE permissions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    resource VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    UNIQUE(resource, action)
);

CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
    role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    permission_id UUID REFERENCES permissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (role_id, permission_id)
);
```

### Permission System Design
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "users": ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "manage_roles"],
    "projects": ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "manage_members"],
    "tasks": ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "assign"],
    "comments": ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
    "time_entries": ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
    "reports": ["read", "export"]
  }
}
```

### Role Definitions
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "super_admin": {
      "permissions": ["*:*"],
      "description": "Full system access"
    },
    "org_admin": {
      "permissions": [
        "users:create", "users:read", "users:update", "users:manage_roles",
        "projects:create", "projects:read", "projects:update", "projects:delete",
        "reports:read", "reports:export"
      ]
    },
    "project_manager": {
      "permissions": [
        "projects:read", "projects:update", "projects:manage_members",
        "tasks:create", "tasks:read", "tasks:update", "tasks:delete", "tasks:assign",
        "comments:create", "comments:read", "comments:update", "comments:delete",
        "time_entries:read", "reports:read"
      ]
    },
    "team_member": {
      "permissions": [
        "projects:read", "tasks:create", "tasks:read", "tasks:update",
        "comments:create", "comments:read", "comments:update",
        "time_entries:create", "time_entries:read", "time_entries:update"
      ]
    },
    "viewer": {
      "permissions": [
        "projects:read", "tasks:read", "comments:read", "time_entries:read"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
