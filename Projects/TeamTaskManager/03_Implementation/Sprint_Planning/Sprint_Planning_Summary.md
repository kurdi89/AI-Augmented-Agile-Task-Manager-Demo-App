- **Participants**: Full Development Team + Product Owner

### Sprint Planning Outcomes

#### Sprint 1 (July 5-18, 2025)
**Status**: ✅ PLANNED & COMMITTED

**Sprint Goal**: Establish secure authentication foundation and core user management

**Key Metrics**:
- **Story Points Committed**: 34 points
- **User Stories Selected**: 8 stories
- **Team Capacity**: 400 hours
- **Capacity Utilization**: 76.5%

**Focus Areas**:
- Complete user authentication system
- Implement role-based access control
- Establish security foundations
- Setup development infrastructure

## Sprint Planning Decisions

### 1. Team Velocity Estimation
**Decision**: Set initial velocity at 34 story points for Sprint 1
**Rationale**: Conservative estimate for first sprint with new team
**Risk Mitigation**: 10% buffer built into capacity planning

### 2. User Story Prioritization
**High Priority Stories** (Must Complete):
- US-001: User Registration (5 pts)
- US-002: User Login (3 pts)
- US-003: Password Reset (5 pts)
- US-005: Role-Based Access Control (8 pts)
- US-006: Session Management (5 pts)

**Medium Priority Stories** (Should Complete):
- US-004: User Profile Management (3 pts)
- US-008: User Logout (2 pts)
- US-009: Token Refresh (3 pts)

### 3. Team Assignments
**Backend Developer 1**: Authentication core (US-001, US-002, US-006, US-009)
**Backend Developer 2**: Security & RBAC (US-003, US-005)
**Frontend Developer**: UI Components (US-004, US-008)
**QA Engineer**: Testing & Validation (All stories)

### 4. Technical Architecture Decisions
**Authentication Method**: JWT with refresh tokens
**Database**: PostgreSQL for user data
**Caching**: Redis for session management
**Email Service**: SendGrid for notifications
**Security**: OWASP compliance standards

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Security Implementation Complexity**
   - **Risk Level**: High
   - **Mitigation**: External security review, incremental implementation

2. **Email Service Integration**
   - **Risk Level**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback provider configured, early integration testing

3. **Role-Based Access Control Complexity**
   - **Risk Level**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Phased implementation, comprehensive testing
