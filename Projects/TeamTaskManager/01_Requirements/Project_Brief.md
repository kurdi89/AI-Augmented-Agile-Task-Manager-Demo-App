# Project Brief - Team Task Manager

## 1. Project Vision

To create a comprehensive team collaboration task management application that enables seamless project coordination through an intuitive Kanban board interface, empowering teams to efficiently track, manage, and complete tasks while maintaining full visibility into project progress and team workload.

## 2. Project Goals

- **Goal 1:** Develop a real-time collaborative Kanban board system with To Do, Doing, and Done columns that supports multiple team members working simultaneously
- **Goal 2:** Implement comprehensive task metadata management including creation date, urgency levels, time estimates, assignee tracking, and progress monitoring
- **Goal 3:** Deploy a production-ready web application with user authentication, real-time updates, and responsive design within 4 weeks
- **Goal 4:** Achieve 95% user satisfaction rating for ease of use and collaboration effectiveness
- **Goal 5:** Support teams of 5-50 members with sub-second response times for task operations

## 3. Scope

### In Scope:
- Real-time Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality
- Task creation, editing, and deletion with rich metadata
- User authentication and team management
- Task assignment and reassignment capabilities
- Priority/urgency level management
- Time tracking and estimation features
- Real-time notifications and updates
- Responsive web interface (desktop and mobile)
- Data persistence and backup
- Team collaboration features (comments, mentions)
- Dashboard and reporting views
- Export functionality for tasks and reports

### Out of Scope:
- Mobile native applications (iOS/Android)
- Integration with external tools (Slack, Jira, etc.) in MVP
- Advanced project management features (Gantt charts, resource allocation)
- File attachment system (MVP will support text-based tasks only)
- Advanced reporting and analytics beyond basic metrics
- Multi-language support (English only for MVP)

## 4. Key Stakeholders

| Name / Group | Role |
|--------------|------|
| Development Team | Primary users and testers of the application |
| Team Leads/Managers | Task assignment and progress monitoring |
| Project Owner | Requirements definition and acceptance |
| End Users | Daily task management and collaboration |
| System Administrator | Deployment and maintenance oversight |

## 5. Success Criteria

- [ ] Real-time collaboration with multiple users
- [ ] Complete task metadata system implemented
- [ ] User authentication and authorization working
- [ ] Responsive design across devices
- [ ] Production deployment completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (sub-second response times)
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed with 95% satisfaction

## 6. Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Requirements and Architecture
- **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Core development and backend implementation
- **Phase 3 (Week 3):** Frontend development and integration
- **Phase 4 (Week 4):** Testing, deployment, and user acceptance

## 7. Technology Considerations

- **Frontend:** Modern web framework (React/Vue/Angular)
- **Backend:** RESTful API with real-time capabilities
- **Database:** Relational database for structured task data
- **Authentication:** Secure user management system
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based hosting with CI/CD pipeline
- **Real-time:** WebSocket implementation for live updates

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

- Team members have access to modern web browsers
- Stable internet connectivity for real-time features
- Cloud hosting infrastructure available
- Development team has expertise in chosen technology stack
- Users are comfortable with web-based applications

## 9. Risk Mitigation

- **Technical Risk:** Prototype real-time features early
- **User Adoption:** Conduct user testing throughout development
- **Performance Risk:** Implement caching and optimization strategies
- **Security Risk:** Follow security best practices and conduct reviews
- **Timeline Risk:** Prioritize MVP features and defer nice-to-haves
