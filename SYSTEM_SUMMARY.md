# Multi-Agent SDLC System - Complete Package

## 🎯 What You've Received

I've analyzed your comprehensive multi-agent SDLC system and created a powerful **Cursor Custom Agent Prompt** that leverages the entire system to build any project. Here's what you now have:

### 📋 Main Deliverables

1. **`multi-agent-synthesis/CURSOR_AGENT_PROMPT.md`** - The complete prompt for Cursor's custom agent feature
2. **`HOW_TO_USE_MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM.md`** - Step-by-step guide for using the system
3. **`Projects/`** - Directory where all new projects will be built
4. **`SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`** - This overview document

### 🏗️ System Architecture Leveraged

Your multi-agent system includes:
- **8 Specialized Agents** (Business Analyst, Solutions Architect, Developer, etc.)
- **9 Professional Templates** (PRD, TDD, User Stories, etc.)
- **3 Quality Checklists** (Requirements, Architecture, Story DoD)
- **2 Validation Forms** (PRD Approval, Sprint Review)
- **2 Workflow Procedures** (Architecture Creation, Story Tasks)
- **7 Knowledge Base Documents** (Standards, Principles, Guidelines)

## 🚀 How to Activate the System

### Step 1: Configure Cursor
1. Open Cursor
2. Go to Settings → Features → Custom Agent
3. Copy the entire content from `multi-agent-synthesis/CURSOR_AGENT_PROMPT.md`
4. Paste it into the Custom Agent prompt field
5. Save the configuration

### Step 2: Request a Project
Use this format:
```
Build me a [PROJECT_TYPE] called "[PROJECT_NAME]" that [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION].
Requirements: [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS]
Tech Stack: [PREFERRED_TECHNOLOGIES]
```

### Step 3: Follow the SDLC Flow
The system will automatically:
1. **Phase 1**: Create requirements documents (PRD, Project Brief)
2. **Request your approval**
3. **Phase 2**: Create technical architecture (TDD, System Design)
4. **Request your validation**
5. **Phase 3**: Implement complete application with code, tests, and deployment

## 💡 Example Usage

```
Build me a task management app called "TaskFlow" that helps teams organize projects.
Requirements: User authentication, task assignment, progress tracking, team collaboration, notifications
Tech Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma
```

The system will deliver:
- Complete requirements documentation
